--------------------------------

This Program Currently only works on Windows
Make sure you have the Chrome Browser Installed v.96+

{STEP 1 - DO THIS FIRST BEFORE ANYTHING}
Download the latest release of chrome driver [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads] based on your Chrome browser version at chrome://settings/help
Place your downloaded chromedriver.exe into a folder called chromedrivers/

{YOU ARE GOOD TO GO!!}
Run Auto_Chrome_5.exe
Open a pre-set file inside the script (make sure to pick the right pre-set for you or make your own)

--------------------------------

**Pre-set Builder Commands: **
(Remember, all normal python code and syntax works)
Find CSS and XPATH codes through the inspect window on chrome. 
All base selenium code also works fine (this just makes it so you don't need to setup anything)

- go_to(address, fail_message[optional])

- css_and_key(code, key, fail_message[optional])

- xpath_and_key(code, key, fail_message[optional])

- css_and_click(code, fail_message[optional])

- xpath_and_click(code, fail_message[optional])

- linktext_click(code, key, fail_message[optional])

- wait_for_xpath(code, fail_message[optional])

Must watch video for understanding selenium and making your own automation scripts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRNwTXeJ75U
Important Notes please read before starting:
Do not move anything in or out of the main script folder.
