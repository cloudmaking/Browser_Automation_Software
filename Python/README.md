Find CSS and XPATH codes through the inspect window on chrome. All base selenium code also works fine (this just makes it so you don't need to setup anything)

- go_to(address, fail_message[optional])

- css_and_key(code, key, fail_message[optional])

- xpath_and_key(code, key, fail_message[optional])

- css_and_click(code, fail_message[optional])

- xpath_and_click(code, fail_message[optional])

- linktext_click(code, key, fail_message[optional])

- wait_for_xpath(code, fail_message[optional])



Must watch video for understanding selenium and making your own automation scripts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRNwTXeJ75U

Important Notes please read before starting:

Do not move anything in or out of the main script folder.

(here is a link to a handy script which does that for you: https://github.com/FireMarshmallow/Easy-file-renamer)

As far as know this only works with windows and MAC OS

Message from a MacOS user:

You might need to remove the quarantine attribute from the chromedriver, I did this by issuing the following command in the Terminal: xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/Auto_Chrome_2-main/chromedrivers/chromedriver

You might also need to add the chromedriver to the mac Firewall exception list like so:

System Preferences > Security & Privacy > (Unlock the padlock if necessary) Firewall options > click on the + icon and locate the chromedriver
