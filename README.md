All base selenium code also works fine (this program just makes it so you don't need to setup anything)
MAKE SURE to put "ac." before any selenium code you want to use. (ac. is short for auto_chrome)

- ac.css_and_key(code, key, fail_message[optional])

- ac.xpath_and_key(code, key, fail_message[optional])
